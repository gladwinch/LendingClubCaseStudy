## Technologies Used
- python
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Conclusions
1) Interest Rates and Loan Amounts: Most loans have interest rates below 15% and amounts generally below 15k. High-value loans and rates are exceptions, not significantly impacting overall trends.

2) Borrower Income: Income distribution among borrowers is varied, with a significant number earning between 0 and 15k annually.

3) Repayment Trends: Installments typically range from 200 to 400, indicating a manageable repayment structure for the majority.

4) Loan Performance: A large proportion of loans are fully repaid, suggesting overall healthy loan performance. However, there's a noticeable risk of default, especially in high-interest and large loans.

5) Common Loan Purposes: Debt consolidation and credit card payments are the primary reasons for loan applications, necessitating a focused risk analysis in these categories.

6) Correlations and Risk Indicators: Notable correlations include loan amount with installment payments and interest rates. Default risk is higher in loans with prolonged employment lengths, higher grades (A to G), and specific purposes.

7) Default Trends: Lower default rates in borrowers with around 9 years of employment, higher in those with 10+ years. Increasing interest rates and loan amounts correlate with higher default risks.
